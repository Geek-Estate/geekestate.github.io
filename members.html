   	The GEM will not appear in search when you choose the option to "Find a Mighty Network." This is because it’s a technically a “secret” network.

In order to access it:

Once you've downloaded the app, you’ll need to log into the GEM on the web (community.geekestate.com) using your phone's browser.
From your mobile browser, you'll see a prompt along the bottom to "View in App."
Tap on that link and log into the GEM on the mobile app.

Note: It will only be necessary to do this on the first visit to the GEM.
    
   
<strong>Account management: Billing</strong>

You can view payments and manage your billing account at any time by logging into your Chargebee customer portal.

Go to https://geekestate.chargebeeportal.com/

You will be emailed a one-time password from Chargebee. Input this password, then click “Login”.
From here, you can manage your subscription, change your account information, billing address, and payment method, and view all past invoices.

<strong>Notifications</strong>

We use a combination of Mighty Networks and Mailchimp. All content is published first in Mighty Networks, and a subset of that is distributed via Mailchimp.

In order to opt-out of the Mailchimp version of the weekly emails, scroll to the bottom of any GEM email and click “update your preferences”.

For security purposes, you will be sent an email containing a link to update your preferences. Click “Email Me A Link”.
Click on the “Update your preferences” link in your inbox.
From here, you can update your name, email address, profession, company, location, sector, and LinkedIn profile.
To change your email notification settings, click on the dropdown menu under “Receive Newsletters Via” and select whether you would like to receive our transmissions via email or via notifications on our Mighty Networks platform.
When you’re done making changes, click “Update Profile”.

<strong>Mighty Networks Settings</strong>

You can choose to receive GEM platform notifications, such as @mentions and comments on your posts, via email or mobile push notifications.

Email notifications will come from the GEM <geek-estate@mn.co>

From here, you can turn email notifications on or off, choose your preferred email frequency, and edit which notifications you want to receive. You can also select whether you would like to receive mobile push notifications.

FAQ (for members):

I'd like to attend a private lunch. How do I find out when/where they are?
Events are private for members and guests. There are regular monthly lunches in Seattle (limited to 15 attendees), quarterly events in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, as well as meet-ups at major real estate tech conferences and occasional gatherings around the world. Email community@geekestate.com to learn how you can get on the list.
I am a member. Can I bring a guest to a GEM event?
We encourage you to bring colleagues whom you feel would be a good fit for the GEM to in-person events. Please reach out to community@geekestate.com to confirm your guest’s attendance. 
How do payments work?
Membership fees are handled through Chargebee as a quarterly or annual recurring payment profile. You can cancel at any time. See our payment help section here.
How can I get a custom invoice that meets my company's accounting requirements?
Invoices will be sent automatically via email when each payment is due. If you cannot find an invoice, please contact community@geekestate.com.
There are multiple people at my company who are interested. Do you provide a discounted rate?
Memberships are per individual, although we also offer a discounted rate for multiple members from the same company. Please email community@geekestate.com if you're interested in taking advantage of that discount.
 
Can I write a paid guest blog post/sponsored article?
The GEM is a community free from advertisements, and so we do not publish sponsored blog posts.
